This package takes a specially encoded string and renders it into tooltip
(like) window that may be displayed on demand at a specific location.

The string encoding will be "html-like", supporting:

<ff:name></ff>    For use registered font named 'name'
                  Font names may also be used as tags without the leading ff:,
						if desired.  Any closing font tag will be accepted to stop
						using the currently selected font.
<fg:color></fg>   To set a foreground color (bg for background)
<br> or \n        For a line break.  NOTE:  There is no terminating symbol for a line break
<a:align>         Set alignment for text

<l@:#>            Left Align text, starting at column # \
<c@:#>            Center Align text, around column #     > using current font's tmAveCharWidth
<r@:#>            Right Align text, ending at column #  /      ^
<d@:#>            Decimal Align text, with decimal in column # |

   # may be a specific column (determined using the current font's average character width)
	or a fraction (i.e. <r@:2/5>) to a fraction of the current total width
	or ^ for the current center point (based on the current total width)
	or * to re-use the most recently computed @ value (useful in case variable
	text may increase the width)

<ne>              No escapes between this symbol and its end </ne>
                     This means that NONE of the html-like or escaped
                     character symbols will be interpreted (except for
                     the end of 'no escapes' sequence.)

  To terminate an effect, use </xx> where xx is the symbol being ended.
  These controls may be nested, but may not overlap.  That means that
  termination symbols MUST appear in the opposite sequence from where
  the symbols were started!

<sc:#>            Set start column to column # (using DEFAULT font's tmAveCharWidth)
                  NOTE: <sc:#> does not allow a terminating symbol

Special binary characters supported:
   \n     For a line break
   \t     For a tab

Escaped character strings supported:

   \n     Same as binary newline character
   \t     Same as binary tab character
   \ooo   Octal character code (1-3 octal digits)
   \xxxx  Hex character code ('x' followed by 1-3 hex digits)
